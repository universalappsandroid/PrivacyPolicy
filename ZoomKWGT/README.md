# Zoom KWGT Privacy Policy 

This is the Zoom KWGT Privacy Policy. Here we are going to tell you about the data we collect with the app.

Currently we use KAPK for creating the APK, so please take in count their [privacy policy](https://help.kustom.rocks/i418-privacy-policy).

From our side, we don't collect any data apart from the data that Google Play provides us like how many install there was, how many active devices have the app installed, information about the crashes, etc.

However **from our side**, NO PERSONAL DATA is collected. All the info we have is **NON-IDENTIFIABLE** and we don't use it for anything else from viewing how the app is performing.

Hopefully, that covers everything and if you have any doubt, please email us at helpUniversalApps@gmail.com
